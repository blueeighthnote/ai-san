# A non-AI chatbot system where you can talk to Ai-san

Made for the sole purpose of simulating a chatbot environment where I can type messages to Ai-san

Current version: v0.1.1, May 12.


## Other Notes
* This repo uses some official Love Live! SIFAS sprites. Those may be phased out in the future as I draw replacement icons.
* The so-called "AI art" generated by Ai-san are hand-drawn by me. I used crayon and some pieces of paper I had leftover from elementary school.
